<body>Youth Energy Commission aims to become a catalyst for accelerating the growth of youth in the energy sector. YEC

would provide a common platform for interaction between the academia, industries and the government, thus providing 

the youth with the opportunities to explore exciting career prospects in energy sector. For the first time in India, youth 

would get a chance to voice its opinion directly to the policymakers.  A series of conferences, networking events, 

venture capital pitches, events, exhibitions and chance to write articles and policy papers is what awaits the youth.
